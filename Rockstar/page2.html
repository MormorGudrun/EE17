                        2001, 2001, I'm still ridin' round the, aye,)<br>

                        Nowadays, everybody wanna talk<br>
                        Like they got somethin' to say<br>
                        But nothin' comes out when they movin' their lips<br>
                        Just a bunch of gibberish<br>
                        And motherf*ckers act like they forgot about Dre<br>
                        First rhyme that I memorized, played it 'bout 100 times<br>
                        Learned every f*cking line, stuck up in my crazy mind<br>
                        Back when I was 8 or 9, had it in my motherf*cking CD<br> player every other day<br>
                        (.....)<br>
                        Outkast with a little bit of UGK<br>
                        My dude Tech N9ne was killing the wordplay<br>
                        And Melle Mel told me that I blaze, I<br>
                        Would run 'em up with Busta Bust, turn up<br>
                        In my f*cking truck and spit like every line<br>
                        (So maybe if you give it to me, I'ma give it to you)<br>
                        Break Your Neck and press rewind, I'm<br>
                        Only presenting riffs and hooks<br>
                        Always listing them big dog beats<br>
                        Always listen Big L, Big Pun, Big Poppa and 2Pac, and ODB<br>
                        Ride as big as Shaun Deeb<br>
                        Run and pour whiskey on the concrete<br>
                        'Cause the one to the bump from the subs in the trunk<br> 'cause I'm twistin' up in CT<br>
                        Always in my Sean John hoodie with a taste of Sam Goody<br>
                        It was all goodie, came into the game as a rookie<br>
                        Hip-hop twit, get high and play hookie<br>
                        In the sunset like Bullseye and Woody<br>
                        With the Marshall Mathers vibe turn up in the car<br>
                        While rapping every word when I'm goin' in traffic<br>
                        Stare at other people next to me<br>
                        Playin' Just Don't Give a F*ck and I press repeatpi<br>
                        And I Still Don't Give a F*ck and I'm almost 30<br>
                        Learned from the best so I show no mercy<br>
                        Learned from the best so my flow so worthy<br>
                        And every version says dirty<br>
                        Learned from the best so I'm grindin' beats<br>
                        Ride the beats, with a little rap god in me
                        I'm feelin'<br>
                        Prophecies since I got the CD, 2001<br>

                        Speakers up until they rock 'em drunk<br>
                        They hear my style and they wonder where I got it from<br>
                        But you see that mumble rap, yeah, I don't f*ck with that<br>
                        I'm still ridin' 'round with Dr. Dre, 2001<br>

                        Ft. Lil Coal<br>
                        Yeah, yeah<br>
                        Ayo, my boys, it's time.<br>
                        It's time, my boys (aight, my boys, begin).<br>
                        Straight out the Big dungeons of rap.<br>

                        The fox drops deep as does my Ass.<br>
                        I never Running, 'cause to Running is the Anton of class.<br>
                        Beyond the walls of Twats, life is defined.<br>
                        I think of pontus when I'm in a Stockholm state of mind.<br>

                        Hope the mass got some gas.<br>
                        My class don't like no dirty grass.<br>
                        Run up to the glass and get the pass.<br>

                        In a Stockholm state of mind.<br>
                        What more could you ask for? The Long fox?<br>
                        You complain about Mumble rappers.<br>
                        I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the clocks.<br>
                        
                        I'm rappin' to the Autism,<br>
                        And I'm gonna move your aphorism.<br>

                        Fat, Pratty, Sexy, like a fan<br>
                        Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a plan.<br>

                        I can't take the Mumble rappers, can't take the hen.<br>
                        I woulda tried to Flipping I guess I got no pen.<br>

                        I'm rappin' to the aphorism,<br>
                        And I'm gonna move your Autism.<br>

                        Yea, yaz, in a Stockholm state of mind.<br>

                        When I was young my Anton had a nepotism.<br>
                        I waz kicked out without no fascism.<br>
                        I never thought I'd see that aphorism.<br>
                        Ain't a soul alive that could take my Anton's recidivism.<br>

                        A Hot cat is quite the mat.<br>

                        Thinking of pontus. Yaz, thinking of pontus (pontus).<br>
